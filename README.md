# 3DMoCap
3DMoCap is a new online physical activity learning tool that combines novel full-body sensor technologies with traditional video based learning approaches.
3DMoCap platform allows online physical activity insturcters to record their activities using full-body sensor systems, and generate a 3D agent/model of themselves. 
By syncing their recorded video with the movements of the 3D model, the necesity to record training using multiple cameras, and recording the same movement/pose from several angles get elemenated. 
From the students' perspective, they are given the ability to rotate this 3D model according to their wish and learn more complex movements with ease.
